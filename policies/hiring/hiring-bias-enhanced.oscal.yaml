    title: Recruitment Fairness Policy - Enhanced (Adult Income Proxy)
    version: "2.0"
    description: |
      Extended from baseline with Equalized Odds and Predictive Parity metrics.
      These metrics are particularly important in hiring to ensure both equal 
      opportunity (TPR parity) and equal precision (candidates have equal chance
      of being correctly identified as qualified).
