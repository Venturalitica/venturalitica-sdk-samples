    description: |
      Health data requires strict privacy protection (HIPAA, GDPR) combined with
      fairness to ensure equitable diagnosis and treatment recommendations across
      demographic groups. This policy emphasizes k-anonymity, l-diversity, and
      fairness metrics critical for clinical decision-making.
